Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2 is a sequel to the original Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, which was released in 1996. The game takes place 400 years after the events of the first game, in which Kain chose to rule the world as a vampire rather than restore its balance. However, his empire was overthrown by a mysterious faction called the Sarafan, who hunted down and killed most of the vampires. Kain was defeated by their leader, the Sarafan Lord, and went into a coma for centuries.
 
The game begins with Kain waking up in a city called Meridian, where he is greeted by an old vampire named Umah. She tells him that he is part of a resistance group called the Cabal, who are fighting against the Sarafan and their tyrannical rule. Kain learns that he has lost most of his powers and memories, and that he must reclaim them by finding and absorbing the souls of his former lieutenants, who have betrayed him and sided with the Sarafan. He also discovers that the Sarafan Lord has stolen the Soul Reaver, a powerful sword that belongs to Kain.
 
Kain sets out on a quest to regain his throne and his weapon, while facing various enemies and obstacles along the way. He also encounters some allies, such as Vorador, an ancient vampire who mentored him in the past, and Janos Audron, a legendary vampire who holds the key to the origin of their race. Kain must also make some moral choices that will affect the outcome of his story and the fate of the world.
