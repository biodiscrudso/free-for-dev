If you want to spice up your gameplay, you can also try installing a mod that replaces some of the cricket players with characters from Super Mario. This mod was created by a user named momento\_c on Reddit, who shared it on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/7z6y0c/shane_warne_cricket_99_super_mario_mod/). To install it, you will need to download a software called [CDMage](https://www.psx-place.com/resources/cdmage-beta-5.271/), which allows you to edit ISO files.
 
Open CDMage and load the ISO file of Shane Warne Cricket 99. Navigate to the folder called DATA > PLAYER > FACE. You will see a list of files with names like AUS01.BMP, ENG01.BMP, etc. These are the bitmap images of the player faces. You will need to replace some of them with the Super Mario images that momento\_c provided in his post. You can download them from [here](https://imgur.com/a/4fZ0n). Make sure you rename them according to the player names and numbers that you want to replace.
 
For example, if you want to replace Shane Warne with Mario, you will need to rename MARIO.BMP to AUS02.BMP and overwrite the original file in CDMage. You can do this for as many players as you want, but make sure you backup your original ISO file before making any changes. Once you are done, save your modified ISO file and run it on ePSXe as before. You should see your Super Mario characters in action on the cricket field.
 
Enjoy playing Shane Warne Cricket 99 on Windows with Super Mario Mod!
