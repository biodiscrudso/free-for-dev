The fort is famous for its handprints and footprints of Shivaji Maharaj, which are preserved in a temple.
- **Murud-Janjira:** This fort is located on an oval-shaped island in the Arabian Sea, near the town of Murud, in the Raigad district. It was built by the Siddis, a community of African origin, who ruled over the region from the 15th to the 18th century. The fort is considered to be one of the strongest marine forts in India, as it remained unconquered by any enemy, including the Marathas, the Portuguese, and the British. The fort has a complex structure, with 19 bastions, two main gates, a palace, a mosque, and a freshwater lake.
- **Vijaydurg:** This fort is located on a peninsula that juts out into the Arabian Sea, near the town of Devgad, in the Sindhudurg district. It was originally built by the Shilahara dynasty in the 12th century, and later expanded by Shivaji Maharaj in 1664. The fort was also known as "Gibraltar of the East", as it was a formidable naval base and a center of shipbuilding. The fort has a long wall that stretches for about 3 km along the coast, with several bastions and watchtowers. The fort also has a secret underwater tunnel that leads to a nearby village.
